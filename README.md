This project is intended to collect technical documentation about digital TV (e.g. DVB-S2) network interface modules ("NIMs").

With Internet TV streaming, usage of DVB and other digital TV standards is constantly declining in popularity. And so is
the availability of such NIMs. All of the documents in this repository are therefore more or less historical, probably
only relevant to people hacking old hardware.

MOST INFORMATION YOU WILL FIND HERE IS THE RESULT OF REVERSE ENGINEERING AND MIGHT BE WRONG - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
